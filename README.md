A practice project designed to create a minimalist static blog generator. Built with Go, it generates a static site from markdown files with minimalist configuration.

## Features
- **Markdown-based content:** Write your blog posts using Markdown syntax.
- **Configurable layout:** Customize your site's title, menu, footer, and theme colors using a `config.yml` file.
- **Automatic file watching:** Automatically detect changes to your content and update the site.

## Usage

### Configuring the Blog

Edit the `config.yml` file to set your site's title, menu items, contact information, and theme colors. Example:

```yaml
# Blog configuration
title: "My Blog"
description: "This is my blog"

# header
menu:
  - name: "Home"
    url: "/"
  - name: "Post"
    url: "/post"
  - name: "About"
    url: "/about"
  - name: "Link"
